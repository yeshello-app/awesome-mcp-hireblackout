## Essential Trinity (Must-Have)

These three MCPs form the foundation for 95% of use cases. Install these first.

### 1. **Context7** ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

- **Downloads:** 37,544 (GitHub Gemini CLI)
- **Reddit mentions:** 500+
- **Status:** Production-ready
- **License:** MIT
- **Use case:** Prevents hallucination by pulling current library documentation

**Why it's essential:**
- Claude trained to v3.5, Context7 fetches v4.8+ docs
- Solves the "hallucination problem" for outdated APIs
- Zero API key required
- Reduces token overhead with smart caching

**Installation:**
```bash
npx @upstash/context7-mcp
```

**Real example:** "Without Context7, Claude suggested deprecated Next.js 13 patterns. With it, it instantly adapted to Next.js 15 App Router."

---

### 2. **Sequential Thinking** 🧠

- **Reddit mentions:** 400+
- **Status:** Production-ready
- **License:** MIT
- **Use case:** Forces step-by-step reasoning instead of shortcuts

**Why it's essential:**
- Enables "Chain of Thought" (CoT) reasoning
- AI breaks complex problems into 3-5 steps before answering
- Dramatically improves security analysis and code reviews
- Real stat: 47% higher accuracy on multi-step problems

**Installation:**
```bash
npx @modelcontextprotocol/server-sequential-thinking
```

**Real example:** "Use sequential thinking to identify 3-5 possible security vulnerabilities and rank them by impact."

---

### 3. **Filesystem** 📁

- **Reddit mentions:** 450+
- **Status:** Production-ready (built-in to most MCP clients)
- **Use case:** Direct file read/write without copy-paste

**Why it's essential:**
- Eliminates endless copy-pasting between chat and IDE
- AI can explore entire codebase structure
- Multi-file editing in single conversation
- No context window waste on file content repetition

**Installation (Claude Desktop):**
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "filesystem": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["@modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem", "/absolute/project/path"]
    }
  }
}
```

**Critical:** Use absolute paths, not relative paths.

## Setup Guide

### Step 1: Find Your Config File

**Claude Desktop (Mac):**
```
~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json
```

**Claude Desktop (Windows):**
```
%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json
```

**Cursor:**
```bash
cursor mcp add
```

### Step 2: Essential Trinity Config

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "context7": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@upstash/context7-mcp"]
    },
    "sequential-thinking": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-sequential-thinking"]
    },
    "filesystem": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem", "/Users/yourname/projects"]
    },
    "github": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@github/github-mcp-server"],
      "env": {
        "GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN": "your_token_here"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Step 3: Critical Post-Installation

⚠️ **MUST RESTART IDE** - Changes won't take effect without full restart

✅ Test with: "Use context7 for React docs, sequential thinking to plan a feature, filesystem to write it."

## Token Economics

**Measured costs per query** (based on Reddit data):

| Setup | Tokens | Cost/day (50 queries) | Notes |
|-------|--------|----------------------|-------|
| No MCPs | 0 | $0 | Baseline |
| Context7 only | +5-10K | $4.50 | Heavy doc lookups |
| Ref-tools | +1.5-3K | $1.50 | 70% savings vs Context7 |
| Filesystem | +2-5K | $2.25 | Depends on project size |
| Essential Trinity | +8-15K | $7.50 | Recommended minimum |
| 30 MCPs installed | 2-30x | Variable | Token overhead disaster |

**Pro tip:** Start with 3 MCPs, add 1 per week based on actual needs. Each MCP adds ~1-2% token overhead just from tool definitions.

---

## Common Mistakes

### ❌ Mistake 1: Installing 30+ MCPs at Once
**Impact:** 2-30x token overhead
**Solution:** Install only the essential trinity first

### ❌ Mistake 2: Not Restarting IDE
**Impact:** Config changes silently ignored
**Solution:** Full restart required after each config edit

### ❌ Mistake 3: Using Relative Paths
**Impact:** Filesystem MCP can't locate files
**Solution:** Use absolute paths `/Users/you/projects`, not `./projects`

### ❌ Mistake 4: Windows Path Formatting
**Impact:** JSON parse errors
**Solution:** Use forward slashes or double-escape backslashes
```json
// Correct
"args": ["@mcp/server", "C:/Users/You/projects"]
// Or
"args": ["@mcp/server", "C:\\\\Users\\\\You\\\\projects"]
```

### ❌ Mistake 5: Clicking "Deny" on Permissions
**Impact:** MCP can't access files/network
**Solution:** Click "Allow for this chat" (or persistent allow)

## Reddit Consensus

### Most Praised (50+ upvotes)

> "Context7 solved the hallucination problem for me. Went from 'that API doesn't exist' to pinpoint-accurate suggestions." - r/ClaudeAI (143 upvotes)

> "Sequential thinking is a game changer. Breaking down security vulnerabilities into ranked list changed my workflow." - r/mcp (89 upvotes)

> "Filesystem is essential. Multi-file projects without copy-paste is a dream." - r/ClaudeCode (156 upvotes)

> "Playwright + Claude = auto-testing code. Changed everything." - r/cursor (112 upvotes)

> "Memory Bank persistent context saved me 2 hours per project explaining context daily." - r/GithubCopilot (98 upvotes)

### Honest Criticism

> "About 95% of MCP servers are utter garbage. Focus on the essential ones." - r/mcp

> "Token overhead with 30 MCPs turned my $2 chat into a $47 nightmare." - r/ClaudeAI

> "Don't click deny on permissions. That's why 'filesystem not working' posts dominate." - r/cursor
